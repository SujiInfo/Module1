# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **even** or **odd** using `if...else` statements.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.

## 🧾 Program
```
c1=4+2j

c2=5+3j
c3=c1+c2
print(c3)
```

## Result
Thus, the Python program to add two complex numbers was successfully written and executed, and the correct output was obtained.
